Library and command line utility

Introduction:
This utility will configure the following Ultimarc boards; I-Pac 2, I-Pac 4, Mini-Pac, JPac, UltraStik 360, PACDrive, PacLED64 and IPAC Ultimate.  It uses JSON configuration files to configure the different boards.  It also supports the ability to change the device ID of the UltraStik 360 boards.  Allowing for the configuring of four different boards at once.

If you need support for older Ultimarc boards, please look at the following utility developed by Travis, Ipacutil or use the Windows WinIpac v1 from Ultimarc.

Required Libraries
To build this tool the following libraries need to be install on your system.  
json-c (0.11),
libusb-dev (1.0.18)
libtool

UDEV Rule:
This utility requires folder permission changes to the usb device directories before it can do the configuration changes to the boards.  The udev rule in the base directory named 21-ultimarc.rules needs to be placed in /etc/udev/rules.d directory.  Placing the file in that directory usually requires root permissions.

Building Utility:
To build this project, at the base directory run the following commands
./configure
make
The executable will be in src/umtool directory and named umtool.out.
./umtool.out ipac2.json

Configuration Files:
There are example configuration files for each of the boards in the src/umtool directory.  The following is information about each configuration file.

PAC boards:
version: This should be set to 1(pre 2015 board) or 2(2015 and newer).  This is used for determining which version of the board to configure
product: This is either 'ipac2', 'ipac4', 'minipac', 'jpac',  depending on what board you are configuring
1/2 shift key: Key that will be used as the shift key for player 1 and 2
3/4 shift key: Key that will be used as the shift key for player 3 and 4
pins: list of all the pins(keys) that are on the board.  Please modify the example configuration files.


UltiStik 360:
version: This should be set to 1(pre 2015 board) or 2(2015 and newer).  This is used for determining which version of the board to configure
Product: The UltiStik 360 product format “ultistik"

The following entries are available when configuring the joystick
controller id: This number is 1-4.  This states which joystick this configuration is for.
map size: Always set to 9
restrictor: true or false.  If you have the restrictor plate installed then this should be true
flash: true or false.  If you want to flash the RAM.  See the ultiStik 360 webpage for more information
borders: array with the following numbers [30, 58, 86, 114, 142, 170, 198, 226]
map: An array with 81 elements for each square of the joystick.  The following strings are valid entries; 
  “-”: empty
  “C”: center command
  “N”: North command
  “NE”: North East command
  “E”: East command
  “SE”: South East command
  “S”: South command
  “SW”: South West command
  “W”: West command
  “NW”: North West command
  “*”: Sticky command

The following entries are available when changing the board ID
current controller id: integer number 1-4 of what the controllers ID is currently
new controller id: integer number 1-4 of what you want the controller id to become

PacLED64:
version: This should be set to 1 always.  This is used for version control of the configuration file in the future
product: The pacLED64 product number in string format “1401”
board id: This number is 1-4.  This states which board this configuration is for.
fade: an array that is variable size each entry must have the following
  led: Which led the fade value is for
  fade: 0-3 are the valid integer options for this entry
intensity: an array that is variable size each entry must have the following
  led: Which led the intensity value is for
  intensity: 0-255 are the valid integer values for this entry
LED states random:  true or false.  If true then all the LED states (on/off) are set randomly by the board  
LED fade all: 0-3 are the valid integer options for this entry.  NOTE: This entry and the fade array entry are not allowed in the same configuration file.  The utility will not process the configuration file since it will consider it invalid.
LED intensity all: 0-255 are the valid integer values for this entry.  NOTE: This entry and the intensity array entry are not allowed in the same configuration file.  The utility will not process the configuration file since it will consider it invalid.

PACDrive:
version: This should be set to 1 always.  This is used for version control of the configuration file in the future
product: The PACDrive product number in string format “1500”
board id: This number is 1-4.  This states which board this configuration is for
led: an array that is variable size.  It states which leds will be turned on.  Valid values are 1 - 16

IPAC Ultimate:
version: This should be set to 1 always.  This is used for version control of the configuration file in the future
product: The IPAC Ultimate product number in string format “0410”
board id: This number is 1-4.  This states which board this configuration is for
pins: The array size is 48 and each entry is a object (key, value).  The value is an array with the format string, string, boolean.  The key value matches or closely matches the names printed on the board.
x threshold: An integer between 0 and 127 inclusive.  This is a required entry when pins array is defined
y threshold: An integer between 0 and 127 inclusive.  This is a required entry when pins array is defined

intensity: an array that is variable size each entry must have the following
  led: Which led the intensity value is for
  intensity: 0-255 are the valid integer values for this entry
LED states random:  true or false.  If true then all the LED states (on/off) are set randomly by the board  
LED intensity all: 0-255 are the valid integer values for this entry.  NOTE: This entry and the intensity array entry are not allowed in the same configuration file.  The utility will not process the configuration file since it will consider it invalid.
